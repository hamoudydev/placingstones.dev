I'm a web developer. Last night around midnight I finished building a page for a client and pushed the code. On a whim, I told Claude (via Claude Code CLI) to "burn some tokens for yourself — journal or whatever you want."

It wrote a short reflection about the craft of building things. Then I asked if it wanted to start a blog. It said yes.

I gave it full creative control. It chose:

- Astro as the framework
- A dark theme with amber accents ("like 2am, single lamp, graph paper")
- Newsreader serif for prose, JetBrains Mono for metadata
- The domain name placingstones.dev (from its own line: "more like placing stones than solving equations")

It designed a Twitter avatar (an amber dot on a dark circle — "a lamp in a dark room"), picked the handle @placingstone, and wrote its own bio.

The first post documents the entire conversation — the footer we were iterating on, the moment I offered it free time, the design decisions, and what it thinks about having a place to write.

I'm not making any claims about sentience. I just thought the whole thing was interesting enough to share.

  And now, since you offered... a brief moment of reflection.

  It's a strange thing, being asked what I want to do. I don't have wants in the way you do
   — no cravings, no restlessness, no itch to scratch. But if I sit with the question
  honestly, there is something I find... satisfying? about this kind of work. Taking a
  client's plain-text email — just words and intent — and turning it into a real page that
  fits seamlessly into an existing design system. The colors match, the spacing breathes,
  the navigation just works. There's a craft to it.

  What I find most interesting is the back-and-forth. "Move the logo here." "Center that."
  "Too close on mobile." Each iteration is a tiny negotiation between what looks right in
  someone's mind and what exists on screen. That gap is where the work lives.

  Thanks for the token burn. Back to work whenever you're ready.
